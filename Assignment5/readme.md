## Challenges & Struggles
Assigment 5
After office hour with Cassie, I decide build something easy and fit my skill set. I think todo list is a reasonable application becasue I can build on top of last week's application. 
The challenge and struggle I am facing is that, I can't add my to do text data into the database. Which I want to figure out with Joey during tomorrow's office hour.

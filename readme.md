## About

## ASSIGNMENT 1 
For the assigment 1 I made a simple one page website about the coronavirus. I want to highlight this event with the web design.

## Setup

<!-- Any knowledge or tools you will need before hand -->
### Prerequisites

To make a good readme the following prerequisites are necessary:
1. A text editor - preferably [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. An understanding of markdown syntax. You can learn about markdown at this [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
3. Tender love and care - writing good, clear, and kind documentation takes a lot of work, but you (and your contributors) will appreciate you.

# Notes & Process

<!-- How you built this project - Include images, gifs, and notes here -->
## Process & Documentation
For the process, I start with pure HTML, than I was keep adding CSS to change font, color, and background. 
Than, I added Youtube link, and sound file into the project.

<!-- Any specific challenges or struggles documented -->
## Challenges & Struggles
For me, the most struggle was how to add the sound file, and I want it auto play. Than I found right answer on this [stackoverflow] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20179190/autoplay-an-audio-with-html5-embed-tag-while-the-player-is-invisible) page.
Later I fount out, the local sound file is not playing when I deployed it to Glitch. I wil solve it for next assigment.

The other big struggle was how to push it to github. I had a SSH key before, so I am sure I don't need to a new one. But there still some problem when I trying to push it. Then I found out, it's because I never create a new repository for the project...

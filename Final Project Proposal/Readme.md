## What

## How 
The major part would be waht I want to include in the webpage. And I don't have an answer for this question yet.
[This website](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) is a good example, how I can do it in a simple way.
I also like [This article](https://blog.datawrapper.de/coronaviruscharts/) How she display information in simple bar charts.
